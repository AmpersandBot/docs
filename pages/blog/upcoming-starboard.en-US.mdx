Time for another update! In this post, we will take a look at the new v5 version and the things we can expect from it. So, without further ado, let's get started!

## Preliminary information
**The v5 update focuses on slash commands. Prefixed commands will therefore be removed with the introduction of a dashboard on the bot's website.**

AmpersandBot v5 has been rewritten from the ground up in C#, which means that the bot will be much faster and more stable.

## How to configure a Starboard?
Open the dashboard. Log in and then select the server you want to configure. As the final step we select the **Starboard** tab.

First, we enable Starboard.

Then we add a new configuration.

Starboard allows us to customize how the feature is working. All the features are outlined below.

<details>
    <summary>Configuration options</summary>
    - `Starboard Channel` - new messages will be sent to this channel when they meet the criteria set below
    - `Emoji` - allows to set the emoji to detect and how many reactions of this emoji the message needs to be sent to the channel selected aboce
    - `Options` - switches that allow to customize how Starboard works, more information below
    <details>
        <summary>Options</summary>
        - `Allow self-reaction` - allows the user to react to their own messages; their reaction will be removed when this option is disabled
        - `Update message` - when this option is enabled, AmpersandBot will try to update the messages added to a Starboard and remove the ones that have been deleted
        - `Ignore bots` - self-explanatory; when the option is enabled, bot reactions will not be counted toward the reaction threshold
        - `Auto-Star` - AmpersandBot will automatically add the selected reaction to new messages; for this option to work, the channel restriction mode must be set to **Observe**, which has been explained below
    </details>
    - `Channel Restrictions` - the behavior of the feature will vary depending on the channel on which it was called
    <details>
        <summary>Channel restrictions</summary>
        - `Off` - the feature works on every channel
        - `Observe` - the feature works only on selected channels
        - `Ignore` - the feature works on every channel, except for the selected ones
    </details>
    - `Role Restrictions` - the same as Channel Restrictions, but for roles
    <details>
        <summary>Role Restrictions</summary>
        - `Off` - works for everyone, regardless of their roles
        - `Observe` - works only for users with the selected roles
        - `Ignore` - works for everyone, except for users with the selected roles
    </details>
</details>

## Important
If the message is from an age-restricted channel, the message will be sent to the Starboard only when its channel is also age-restricted.

## Final words
Thanks for reading this post and using our bot! If you have any questions, you can ask them on our [support server](https://discord.gg/ggvm5GKbev).
